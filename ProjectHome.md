Use your Android as a simple mobile webcam or cloudcam via WIFI or Mobile Network! Very easy to use with SENSR.NET.

The picture stored in the cloud can be watched from everywhere with a browser or for example my App WebLiveWallpaper. Upload picture with various methods like http, ftp or Dropbox, send it with email or store on your sdcard for example to create a timelapse video.

Use as simple but mobile timed webcam with refresh rates from seconds to hours, with motion detection or your defined daily activity times. High resolution pictures are also possible. Mark the pictures with text or image to advertise for your place or business.

This app provides me with a simple possibility to mail someone (my wife) and start refreshing a webcam view of what I see with one buttontap. Also it can work as a more static webcam with set activity times and picture imprint if you got a spare or partially broken phone you want to place somewhere connected to power running all the time ...

Easiest usage without much setup hassle is with sensr. Then you do not even need your own homepage/server!

In the app press the MENU phone button for settings!

Again:
This webcam app is a bit different. It does not stream video. It is not meant to be placed next to or connected to your Computer. It will not have nice camera preview, fx or settings because old/broken androids can be used. This camera is intended to run without user (interaction) after initial setup possibly with a cheap 2G mobile data plan (in some countries/carriers for example 30 MB of data are free and that is enough to upload several pictures a day!).

For unstable devices autostart and reboot after a number of taken pictures (my cheap jpad tablet for example crashes after about 70 pictures in a row) can be enabled in the settings.

Android 1.5 up for old cheap hardware usage.
